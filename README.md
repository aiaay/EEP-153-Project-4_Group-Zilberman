# EEP-153-Project-4_Group-Zilberman

Target States in India: Tamil Nadu, West Bengal  
**Key: Comparison across two states**

**Goals:**

- In this project we will identify the food demand systems and nutritional systems within the populations of two regions in **India: Bengal (West Bengal) and Tamil Nadu**. Both of these regions suffer from nutritional inadequacy as there has been recently an emphasis on the quantity of food produced (large scale cash crops), rather than diverse nutritional quality. We will assess which nutrients are most lacking in each population and propose policies that will foster a healthier and more sustainable food supply, all while considering food prices, household budgets, and other household characteristics within these populations.


##Instruction for Code Review:

- Since we are doing a cross comparison between two states, we need to replicate our code for two states; the `EEP153_Project 4_Zilberman_Draft_Tamil_Nadu` currently only has the compiled and formatted code for Tamil Nadu. We have yet to combine code for  West Bengal
- Code for West Bengal are in the `draft pieces` folder, and the folder also contains some code on deliverable C and policy cost
