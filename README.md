# EEP-153-Project-4_Group-Zilberman

Target States in India: Tamil Nadu, West Bengal  
**Key: Comparison across two states**

**Goals:**

- In this project we will identify the food demand systems and nutritional systems within the populations of two regions in **India: Bengal (West Bengal) and Tamil Nadu**. Both of these regions suffer from nutritional inadequacy as there has been recently an emphasis on the quantity of food produced (large scale cash crops), rather than diverse nutritional quality. We will assess which nutrients are most lacking in each population and propose policies that will foster a healthier and more sustainable food supply, all while considering food prices, household budgets, and other household characteristics within these populations.


## Remarks for Code Review:

- Since we are doing a cross comparison between two states, we need to replicate our code for two states; we decided to keep it as two seperate notebooks for the sake of memory


## Download Instruction for Code Review:
1. Navigate to the right on the home page of this repo; click into `Releases`
2. Download all three assets under the tag `code_review`
3. Upload all 7 nessary supporting data:
  - `tamil_nadu_final_result.ds`
    - in the release as a binary, not in the actual repo since it exceeded the 25mb max
  - `bengali_t_2.ds`
  - `proj_4_fdc_codes_tamilnadu.csv - Sheet1.csv`
  - `proj_4_fdc_codes_bengal.csv - Sheet1.csv`
  - `fooddatacentral.py`
  - `Dietary Requirements - diet_minimums.csv`
  - `Data` folder (upload as a folder)
    - contain the `food_unit.txt`
5. Upload our notebooks
  - fully formatted for both states
    -  `EEP153_Project 4_Final_Tamil_Nadu.ipynb`
    -  `EEP153_Project 4_Zilberman_Bengal.ipynb`
